      <p>Hello and thank you for browsing my portfolio. My name is Nicholas Ceglia and the primary role for me and my company is to capture your special moments. Whether that be your wedding day or your first production commercial, we are here to help make that day a memorable one and one that you can look back fondly on. 
     I started down this road of videography/cinematography by seeing a fellow videographer and their team at work at a wedding that I was attending. This ignited a spark within me to want to be that person to be able to do something that meant the world to others and can change people's lives with the product/ service that I could provide for them. From there I decided to enroll in Full Sail University to pursue a degree in Digital Cinematography.
    Through my time at Full Sail, I learned the necessary skills and habits needed to start making my passion into a career. With these lessons, I hope to continue learning and improving my craft every day to bring you, my potential clients, the best product that I can provide.</p>
